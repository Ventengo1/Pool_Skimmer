# June 12: Brainstorming and Finding Parts

- This is my second project and I decided to make it something more useful than a rocket
- Got inspiration becuase just opened my pool and started maintence and it is super dirty
- Idea:
- 2 servos propel it with solar panels to power it so it can run whenever it is sunny
- Started off by finding parts which for the motors wasn't too dificult
- Spent around 30 minutes on that as my idea of what I was going to do kept changing
- Then worked on finding solar panels
- Issue is that to get 5v 3w solar panel is very difficult
- Also very expensive and they don't really sell pre-soldered ones
